# Minecraft Assets Deobfuscator

## A super lightweight Java program that remaps your .minecraft/assets folder!

### Usage

Just run it. If something went wrong, modify the code. But it should work on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

### Features

1. Remaps your ./minecraft/assets Folder
2. Checks asset file size (Not sure the hash's hashing method, and it should takes more time. In my opinion, checking File size is enough.)
